0,Chapter 1 In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. ,4
1,"""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."" ",4
2,"He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. ",4
3,"In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. ",4
4,"THE ABNORMAL MIND IS QUICK TO DETECT AND ATTACH ITSELF TO THIS QUALITY WHEN IT APPEARS IN A NORMAL PERSON, AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT IN COLLEGE I WAS UNJUSTLY ACCUSED OF BEING A POLITICIAN, BECAUSE I WAS PRIVY TO THE SECRET GRIEFS OF WILD, UNKNOWN MEN. ",4
5,"Most of the confidences were unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. ",4
6,Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. ,4
7,"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. ",4
8,"And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. ",4
9,Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. ,4
100,"""You live in West Egg,"" she remarked contemptuously. ",105
101,"""I know somebody there."" ""I don't know a single----"" ""You must know Gatsby."" ""Gatsby?"" demanded Daisy. ",105
102,"""What Gatsby?"" ",105
103,Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square. ,105
104,"Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. ",105
105,"""WHY CANDLES?"" OBJECTED DAISY, FROWNING. ",105
106,She snapped them out with her fingers. ,105
107,"""In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year."" ",105
108,She looked at us all radiantly. ,105
109,"""Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it."" ""We ought to plan something,"" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. ",105
110,"""All right,"" said Daisy. ",105
156,"She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued: ""I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----"" her voice sang ""----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?"" ""Very romantic,"" he said, and then miserably to me: ""If it's light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables."" ",161
157,"The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. ",161
158,"Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. ",161
159,I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. ,161
160,"To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police. The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee. Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. ""We don't know each other very well, Nick,"" she said suddenly. ""Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding."" ""I wasn't back from the war."" ""That's true."" ",161
161,"SHE HESITATED. ""WELL, I'VE HAD A VERY BAD TIME, NICK, AND I'M PRETTY CYNICAL ABOUT EVERYTHING."" ",161
162,"Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. ""I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything."" ""Oh, yes."" ",161
163,She looked at me absently. ,161
164,"""Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?"" ""Very much."" ""It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."" ""You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,"" she went on in a convinced way. ""Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW. I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything."" ",161
165,"Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. ""Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!"" ",161
166,"The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged. Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the ""Saturday Evening Post""--the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms. When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand. ""To be continued,"" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, ""in our very next issue."" ",161
217,We went by way of Marseilles. ,222
218,We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. ,222
219,"We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. ",222
220,"God, how I hated that town!"" ",222
221,"The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room. ""I almost made a mistake, too,"" she declared vigorously. ""I almost married a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below you!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure."" ""Yes, but listen,"" said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, ""at least you didn't marry him."" ""I know I didn't."" ""Well, I married him,"" said Myrtle, ambiguously. ""And that's the difference between your case and mine."" ""Why did you, Myrtle?"" demanded Catherine. ""Nobody forced you to."" ",222
222,"MYRTLE CONSIDERED. ""I MARRIED HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WAS A GENTLEMAN,"" SHE SAID FINALLY. ""I THOUGHT HE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT BREEDING, BUT HE WASN'T FIT TO LICK MY SHOE."" ""YOU WERE CRAZY ABOUT HIM FOR A WHILE,"" SAID CATHERINE. ""CRAZY ABOUT HIM!"" CRIED MYRTLE INCREDULOUSLY. ""WHO SAID I WAS CRAZY ABOUT HIM? I NEVER WAS ANY MORE CRAZY ABOUT HIM THAN I WAS ABOUT THAT MAN THERE."" ",222
223,"She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past. ""The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out. She looked around to see who was listening: "" 'Oh, is that your suit?' I said. 'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon."" ""She really ought to get away from him,"" resumed Catherine to me. ""They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the first sweetie she ever had."" ",222
224,"The bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine who ""felt just as good on nothing at all."" ",222
225,"Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. ",222
226,"I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. ",222
227,"Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. ",222
305,"There were three married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. ",310
306,"Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety. ""Let's get out,"" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour. ""This is much too polite for me."" ",310
307,"We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. ",310
308,"The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way. ",310
309,"The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there. ",310
310,"SHE COULDN'T FIND HIM FROM THE TOP OF THE STEPS, AND HE WASN'T ON THE VERANDA. ",310
311,"On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas. ",310
312,"A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. ",310
313,As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot. ,310
314,"""What do you think?"" he demanded impetuously. ",310
315,"""About what?"" ",310
373,"I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. ",378
374,"When the ""Jazz History of the World"" was over girls were putting their heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing that some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link. ""I beg your pardon."" ",378
375,"Gatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us. ""Miss Baker?"" he inquired. ""I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone."" ""With me?"" she exclaimed in surprise. ""Yes, madame."" ",378
376,"She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings. ",378
377,I was alone and it was almost two. ,378
378,FOR SOME TIME CONFUSED AND INTRIGUING SOUNDS HAD ISSUED FROM A LONG MANY-WINDOWED ROOM WHICH OVERHUNG THE TERRACE. ,378
379,"Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside. ",378
380,The large room was full of people. ,378
381,"One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. ",378
382,"She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. ",378
383,"A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep. ",378
424,I glanced back once. ,429
425,"A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. ",429
426,"A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell. ",429
427,Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. ,429
428,"On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs. ",429
429,MOST OF THE TIME I WORKED. ,429
430,In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. ,429
431,I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. ,429
432,"I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away. ",429
433,I took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. ,429
434,There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work. ,429
497,Everybody had seen it. ,502
498,"It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. ",502
499,Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town. ,502
500,"I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. ",502
501,"So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door. ",502
502,AND THEN CAME THAT DISCONCERTING RIDE. ,502
503,We hadn't reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit. ,502
504,"""Look here, old sport,"" he broke out surprisingly. ",502
505,"""What's your opinion of me, anyhow?"" ",502
506,"A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves. ",502
507,"""Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,"" he interrupted. ",502
548,"With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar ""jug--jug--SPAT!"" of a motor cycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside. ",553
549,"""All right, old sport,"" called Gatsby. ",553
550,We slowed down. ,553
551,Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes. ,553
552,"""Right you are,"" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. ",553
553,"""KNOW YOU NEXT TIME, MR. GATSBY. EXCUSE ME!"" ""WHAT WAS THAT?"" ",553
554,I inquired. ,553
555,"""The picture of Oxford?"" ""I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year."" ",553
556,"Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. ",553
557,"The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. ",553
558,"A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends. ",553
604,"I repeated. The idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe. ""How did he happen to do that?"" ",609
605,"I asked after a minute. ""He just saw the opportunity.",609
606,""" ""Why isn't he in jail?"" ""They can't get him, old sport. ",609
607,He's a smart man.,609
608,""" I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room. ""Come along with me for a minute,"" I said. ""I've got to say hello to someone.",609
609,""" WHEN HE SAW US TOM JUMPED UP AND TOOK HALF A DOZEN STEPS IN OUR DIRECTION. ""WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?"" HE DEMANDED EAGERLY. ""DAISY'S FURIOUS BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T CALLED UP.",609
610,""" ""This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.",609
611,""" They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face. ""How've you been, anyhow?"" demanded Tom of me. ""How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?"" ""I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.",609
612,""" I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there. One October day in nineteen-seventeen---- (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel) --I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving way. The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, ""anyways, for an hour!"" ",609
613,"When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until I was five feet away. ""Hello Jordan,"" she called unexpectedly. ""Please come here.",609
614,""" I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four years--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the same man. That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't get into the army at all. By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other. "" 'Gratulate me,"" she muttered. ""Never had a drink before but oh, how I do enjoy it."" ""What's the matter, Daisy?"" ",609
702,Celebrated people.,707
703,""" Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees. And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of ""the Merton College Library"" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter. We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the ""boarder.",707
704,""" I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall. He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs. His bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh. ""It's the funniest thing, old sport,"" he said hilariously. ""I can't--when I try to----"" ",707
705,"He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock. Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high. ""I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. ",707
706,"He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.",707
707,""" HE TOOK OUT A PILE OF SHIRTS AND BEGAN THROWING THEM, ONE BY ONE BEFORE US, SHIRTS OF SHEER LINEN AND THICK SILK AND FINE FLANNEL WHICH LOST THEIR FOLDS AS THEY FELL AND COVERED THE TABLE IN MANY-COLORED DISARRAY. WHILE WE ADMIRED HE BROUGHT MORE AND THE SOFT RICH HEAP MOUNTED HIGHER--SHIRTS WITH STRIPES AND SCROLLS AND PLAIDS IN CORAL AND APPLE-GREEN AND LAVENDER AND FAINT ORANGE WITH MONOGRAMS OF INDIAN BLUE. SUDDENLY WITH A STRAINED SOUND, DAISY BENT HER HEAD INTO THE SHIRTS AND BEGAN TO CRY STORMILY. ""THEY'RE SUCH BEAUTIFUL SHIRTS,"" SHE SOBBED, HER VOICE MUFFLED IN THE THICK FOLDS. ""IT MAKES ME SAD BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH--SUCH BEAUTIFUL SHIRTS BEFORE."" ",707
708,"After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound. ""If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,"" said Gatsby. ""You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.",707
709,""" Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk. ""Who's this?"" ""That? ",707
710,"That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.",707
711,""" The name sounded faintly familiar. ""He's dead now. ",707
712,He used to be my best friend years ago.,707
773,"She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was ""common but pretty,"" and I knew that except for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having a good time. We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had been called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now. ""How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?"" ",778
774,"The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes. ""Wha?"" ",778
775,"A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence: ""Oh, she's all right now. ",778
776,When she's had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. ,778
777,I tell her she ought to leave it alone.,778
778,""" ""I DO LEAVE IT ALONE,"" AFFIRMED THE ACCUSED HOLLOWLY. ""WE HEARD YOU YELLING, SO I SAID TO DOC CIVET HERE: 'THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT NEEDS YOUR HELP, DOC.' "" ""SHE'S MUCH OBLIGED, I'M SURE,"" SAID ANOTHER FRIEND, WITHOUT GRATITUDE. ""BUT YOU GOT HER DRESS ALL WET WHEN YOU STUCK HER HEAD IN THE POOL.",778
779,""" ""Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,"" mumbled Miss Baedeker. ""They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.",778
780,""" ""Then you ought to leave it alone,"" countered Doctor Civet. ""Speak for yourself!"" cried Miss Baedeker violently. ""Your hand shakes. ",778
781,"I wouldn't let you operate on me!"" ",778
782,"It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek. ""I like her,"" said Daisy, ""I think she's lovely.",778
783,""" But the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented ""place"" that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand. I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass. ""Who is this Gatsby anyhow?"" demanded Tom suddenly. ""Some big bootlegger?"" ""Where'd you hear that?"" ",778
828,""" ""What a low, vulgar girl!"" ""I don't care!"" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room. ""Bles-sed pre-cious,"" she crooned, holding out her arms. ""Come to your own mother that loves you.",833
829,""" The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother's dress. ""The Bles-sed pre-cious! ",833
830,Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? ,833
831,"Stand up now, and say How-de-do.",833
832,""" Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had ever really believed in its existence before. ""I got dressed before luncheon,"" said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy. ""That's because your mother wanted to show you off.",833
833,""" HER FACE BENT INTO THE SINGLE WRINKLE OF THE SMALL WHITE NECK. ""YOU DREAM, YOU. ",833
834,You absolute little dream.,833
835,""" ""Yes,"" admitted the child calmly. ""Aunt Jordan's got on a white dress too.",833
836,""" ""How do you like mother's friends?"" ",833
837,"Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. ""Do you think they're pretty?"" ""Where's Daddy?"" ""She doesn't look like her father,"" explained Daisy. ""She looks like me. ",833
838,She's got my hair and shape of the face.,833
937,"Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered ""Hum!"" in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair. ""That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?"" said Tom sharply. ""What is?"" ""All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?"" ""Now see here, Tom,"" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, ""if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep."" ",942
938,"As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March from the ballroom below. ""Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!"" cried Jordan dismally. ""Still--I was married in the middle of June,"" Daisy remembered, ""Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?"" ""Biloxi,"" he answered shortly. ",942
939,"""A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a fact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee."" ""They carried him into my house,"" appended Jordan, ""because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died."" ",942
940,"After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, ""There wasn't any connection."" ""I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,"" I remarked. ",942
941,"""That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use today."" ",942
942,"THE MUSIC HAD DIED DOWN AS THE CEREMONY BEGAN AND NOW A LONG CHEER FLOATED IN AT THE WINDOW, FOLLOWED BY INTERMITTENT CRIES OF ""YEA--EA--EA!"" AND FINALLY BY A BURST OF JAZZ AS THE DANCING BEGAN. ",942
943,"""We're getting old,"" said Daisy. ",942
944,"""If we were young we'd rise and dance."" ""Remember Biloxi,"" Jordan warned her. ",942
945,"""Where'd you know him, Tom?"" ""Biloxi?"" ",942
946,He concentrated with an effort. ,942
947,"""I didn't know him. He was a friend of Daisy's."" ""He was not,"" she denied. ",942
998,She hesitated. ,1003
999,"Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late. ""I never loved him,"" she said, with perceptible reluctance. ""Not at Kapiolani?"" demanded Tom suddenly. ""No."" ",1003
1000,"From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air. ""Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?"" ",1003
1001,"There was a husky tenderness in his tone. "". . . Daisy?"" ""Please don't."" ",1003
1002,"Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. ""There, Jay,"" she said--but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. ",1003
1003,SUDDENLY SHE THREW THE CIGARETTE AND THE BURNING MATCH ON THE CARPET. ,1003
1004,"""Oh, you want too much!"" she cried to Gatsby. ",1003
1005,"""I love you now--isn't that enough? I can't help what's past."" ",1003
1006,"She began to sob helplessly. ""I did love him once--but I loved you too."" ",1003

1092,"""And what color's your car?"" ""It's a blue car, a coupe."" ""We've come straight from New York,"" I said. ",1094
1093,Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away. ,1094
1094,"""NOW, IF YOU'LL LET ME HAVE THAT NAME AGAIN CORRECT----"" ",1094
1095,"Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair and came back. ",1094
1096,"""If somebody'll come here and sit with him!"" he snapped authoritatively. ",1094
1097,He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. ,1094
1098,"Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. ",1094
1099,"As he passed close to me he whispered ""Let's get out."" ",1094
1141,""" ""Go away NOW, old sport?"" ""Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.",1146
1142,""" He wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn't bear to shake him free. It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody--told it to me because ""Jay Gatsby"" had broken up like glass against Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy. She was the first ""nice"" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions. But he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand. He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world. But he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how extraordinary a ""nice"" girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt married to her, that was all. When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor. ""I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. ",1146
1143,"I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she didn't, because she was in love with me too. ",1146
1144,She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. ,1146
1145,". . . Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn't care. ",1146
1146,"WHAT WAS THE USE OF DOING GREAT THINGS IF I COULD HAVE A BETTER TIME TELLING HER WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO?"" ",1146
1147,"On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep. He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why he couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all. For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the ""Beale Street Blues"" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor. Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision must be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality--that was close at hand. That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford. It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning, gold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool lovely day. ""I don't think she ever loved him.",1146
1148,""" Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. ""You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. ",1146
1149,"He told her those things in a way that frightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying."" ",1146
1150,"He sat down gloomily. ""Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were first married--and loved me more even then, do you see?"" ",1146
1151,"Suddenly he came out with a curious remark: ""In any case,"" he said, ""it was just personal.",1146
1196,""" ""Sorry. ",1201
1197,I'm afraid no one's there.,1201
1198,""" I went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain. ""Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. ",1201
1199,You've got to try hard. ,1201
1200,I can't go through this alone.,1201
1201,""" SOME ONE STARTED TO ASK ME QUESTIONS BUT I BROKE AWAY AND GOING UPSTAIRS LOOKED HASTILY THROUGH THE UNLOCKED PARTS OF HIS DESK--HE'D NEVER TOLD ME DEFINITELY THAT HIS PARENTS WERE DEAD. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING--ONLY THE PICTURE OF DAN CODY, A TOKEN OF FORGOTTEN VIOLENCE STARING DOWN FROM THE WALL. NEXT MORNING I SENT THE BUTLER TO NEW YORK WITH A LETTER TO WOLFSHEIM WHICH ASKED FOR INFORMATION AND URGED HIM TO COME OUT ON THE NEXT TRAIN. THAT REQUEST SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS WHEN I WROTE IT. I WAS SURE HE'D START WHEN HE SAW THE NEWSPAPERS, JUST AS I WAS SURE THERE'D BE A WIRE FROM DAISY BEFORE NOON--BUT NEITHER A WIRE NOR MR. WOLFSHEIM ARRIVED, NO ONE ARRIVED EXCEPT MORE POLICE AND PHOTOGRAPHERS AND NEWSPAPER MEN. WHEN THE BUTLER BROUGHT BACK WOLFSHEIM'S ANSWER I BEGAN TO HAVE A FEELING OF DEFIANCE, OF SCORNFUL SOLIDARITY BETWEEN GATSBY AND ME AGAINST THEM ALL. _DEAR MR. CARRAWAY. THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE SHOCKS OF MY LIFE TO ME I HARDLY CAN BELIEVE IT THAT IT IS TRUE AT ALL. SUCH A MAD ACT AS THAT MAN DID SHOULD MAKE US ALL THINK. I CANNOT COME DOWN NOW AS I AM TIED UP IN SOME VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS AND CANNOT GET MIXED UP IN THIS THING NOW. IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO A LITTLE LATER LET ME KNOW IN A LETTER BY EDGAR. I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I AM WHEN I HEAR ABOUT A THING LIKE THIS AND AM COMPLETELY KNOCKED DOWN AND OUT. YOURS TRULY MEYER WOLFSHEIM_ AND THEN HASTY ADDENDA BENEATH: _LET ME KNOW ABOUT THE FUNERAL ETC DO NOT KNOW HIS FAMILY AT ALL._ WHEN THE PHONE RANG THAT AFTERNOON AND LONG DISTANCE SAID CHICAGO WAS CALLING I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE DAISY AT LAST. BUT THE CONNECTION CAME THROUGH AS A MAN'S VOICE, VERY THIN AND FAR AWAY. ""THIS IS SLAGLE SPEAKING. . . ."" ""YES?"" ",1201
1202,"The name was unfamiliar. ""Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?"" ""There haven't been any wires."" ""Young Parke's in trouble,"" he said rapidly. ""They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----"" ""Hello!"" ",1201
1203,"I interrupted breathlessly. ""Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby's dead."" ",1201
1204,"There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken. I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came. It was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand. ""I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,"" he said. ""It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away."" ""I didn't know how to reach you."" ",1201
1205,"His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room. ""It was a mad man,"" he said. ""He must have been mad."" ""Wouldn't you like some coffee?"" ",1201
1206,"I urged him. ""I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----"" ""Carraway."" ""Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?"" ",1201
1267,I'd never seen him since then. ,1272
1268,I don't know how he knew about the funeral or even his name. ,1272
1269,The rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby's grave. ,1272
1270,"I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn't sent a message or a flower. ",1272
1271,"Dimly I heard someone murmur ""Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,"" and then the owl-eyed man said ""Amen to that,"" in a brave voice. ",1272
1272,WE STRAGGLED DOWN QUICKLY THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE CARS. ,1272
1273,Owl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate. ,1272
1274,"""I couldn't get to the house,"" he remarked. ",1272
1275,"""Neither could anybody else."" ""Go on!"" ",1272
1276,He started. ,1272
1277,"""Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds."" ",1272
